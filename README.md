# Sleek
This is a fully functional version of the MIT License Sleek Dashboard. Developed with Visual Studio 2017 and ASP.NET Core 2, it implements every feature provided by the template.

##Latest Release
Users can sign in and controls are kept in context with their credentials. (Admin, Manager or Ordinary User)

## Important

This solution is a new work in progress and will be getting updates for several more days. Feel free to look it over, but many parts of it are still incomplete.

## Known Issues

* Registration and Password Recovery are unfinished and first on the list for completion.
* The system is based on a Customer with multiple users. Customers are created during the registration process and can create an unlimited number of users for their account.
* Currently, there are no custom validation attributes. Several will be added as the project progresses. (Model validation)
* The project is compatible with ASP.NET Core identity, but does not use the built-in tables for role management.

## Overview

If you are developing and Enterprise scale application or working with a team of developers, I would suggest you start with one of the excellent [Free and Commercial Templates](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/Templates) available from [ASP.NET Boilerplate](https://aspnetboilerplate.com) as they are available in Angular, Vue and React versions and have been built specifically for this purpose.

## Current Features

* Developed with ASP.NET Core 2.2.1 and Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (Windows or Linux)
* Maintains compatibility with multiple database vendors by avoiding stored procedures and triggers (EF6 / LINQ)
* Supports claims-based authentication without the complexity of the built-in user tables

## Coming Soon

In addition to the functionality already implemented, the following features will soon be available:

* Complete documentation with detailed instructions.
* Built-in project management system with support for GIT and Mercurial.
* Entity Framework Based API with JWT Authentication
* Mailing address correction and certification via the USPS Webtools API
* Functioning Notification, Message and Alert Centers
* Microsoft SignalR-Based Chat
* Website Search Feature

## Change History

* Sign-up, Password Recovery and Contact forms set the form autocomplete="off" and the field autocomplete="new-password".
